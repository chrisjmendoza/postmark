# Postmark — Active TODOs
Last updated: May 8, 2026
Ordered by priority tier. Work top-to-bottom within each tier.

---

## 🔴 TIER 1 — Core Loop (app unusable as daily driver without these)

### Thread view — finish the experience
- [x] **Reaction chip position** — chips moved to Column sibling of the
      bubble Box; `offset(y=(-12).dp)` badges the bubble bottom edge;
      `align(Start/End)` for sent/received; timestamp offset removed so
      it follows naturally in the Column flow. iMessage-style badge look.
- [x] **Reaction pill overflow** — FlowRow replaces Row in `ReactionPills`;
      bubble width captured via `onSizeChanged` constrains pills so they
      wrap to a second line instead of overflowing on short messages.
- [x] **Custom date range selection** — "Date range" option in selection
      mode; two-field date picker bottom sheet; auto-selects all messages
      within range. Useful for exporting a full month at once.
- [x] **Scroll-to-date fix** — first message of selected date should
      appear near top of screen, not bottom.
- [x] **Thread view performance** — flat `ThreadListItem` render model
      pre-computed in ViewModel off-thread; LazyColumn flattened to single
      `items()` with stable keys; six `remember` blocks removed; Coil
      `.size(560, 480)` on MMS images; LaunchedEffect blocks extracted;
      all ViewModel callbacks stabilised with `remember(viewModel)`; Trace
      markers added for Perfetto profiling.

### Default SMS role + real sync (Samsung S24 Ultra blocker)
- [x] **Onboarding screen** — implemented in OnboardingScreen.kt;
      RoleManager (API 29+) / ACTION_CHANGE_DEFAULT fallback;
      onboarding_completed pref gates it to first launch only.
- [x] **Samsung READ_SMS fix** — `content://sms` returns null cursor
      despite permissions. Fallback queries `content://sms/inbox`,
      `content://sms/sent`, `content://sms/draft` and merges results.
      Detailed logging under tag `PostmarkSync` incl. device info.
- [x] **Handle role denial gracefully** — persistent but dismissable
      banner in conversation list explaining read-only limitations.
      Don't re-prompt on every launch.

### Notifications — required for default SMS role
- [x] **Notification channel setup** — incoming_sms (IMPORTANCE_HIGH)
      and sync_service (IMPORTANCE_LOW) created in PostmarkApplication.
- [x] **Incoming SMS notification** — SmsReceiver posts heads-up with
      sender + body; multi-part bodies reassembled; POST_NOTIFICATIONS
      declared and requested on API 33+.
- [x] **Enforce mute in SmsReceiver** — `isMuted` flag is stored in DB
      but `SmsReceiver` doesn't check it yet; muted threads still
      trigger notifications. Check `ThreadRepository.isMuted(address)`
      before posting notification.
- [x] **Direct reply action** — `RemoteInput` in notification so user
      can reply without opening the app. Android 7+ standard expectation.
- [x] **Mark as read action** — second notification action button.
- [x] **Notification grouping** — bundle multiple messages from same
      thread; summary notification across threads.
- [x] **Privacy mode** — global toggle in Settings → Notifications;
      when enabled SmsReceiver shows "New message" with no sender/body
      and omits reply + mark-read actions.
- [x] **Pinned / Favorite conversations** — `isPinned` on `ThreadEntity`
      (schema v6); threads sort pinned-first; 📌 badge on row; long-press
      any conversation row → context menu with Pin/Unpin and Mute/Unmute;
      also accessible from the ⋮ menu inside the thread view.
- [ ] **Per-number notification filtering** — let user exclude specific
      numbers/threads from triggering notifications entirely (distinct
      from mute, which suppresses sound but still posts). UI entry point:
      thread ⋮ menu or Notification settings screen. Store as a flag on
      `ThreadEntity` (e.g. `notificationsEnabled BOOLEAN DEFAULT true`);
      check in `SmsReceiver` before posting.
- [x] **SMS send** — basic send wired up with optimistic insert.
- [x] **Failed send state** — bubble shows a red ✕ or "!" indicator
      with a tap-to-retry affordance when FAILED status received.
- [ ] **Multipart message handling** — verify all parts arrive before
      marking delivered; handle out-of-order part delivery.
- [ ] **Send queue** — if no signal, queue outgoing messages and
      send when connectivity restored. Show "Queued" status on bubble.

---

## 🟡 TIER 2 — Feature Complete (needed before Play Store submission)

### MMS support
- [x] **Sync MMS from content://mms** — `getMmsBody()` / `getMmsBodyIncremental()` in
      both sync handlers return `MmsParts(body, attachmentUri, mimeType)`. Queries
      `_id`, `ct`, `text`; builds stable `content://mms/part/{id}` URI for media parts;
      skips SMIL. Room schema v9 adds `attachmentUri` + `mimeType` columns.
- [x] **Inline image display** — `AsyncImage` (Coil 2.7.0) in `MmsAttachment` composable,
      `fillMaxWidth`, `ContentScale.Crop`, max 240 dp height, rounded 8 dp corners.
- [x] **Inline video display** — `Box` with `PlayArrow` icon overlay, 120 dp height,
      `surfaceVariant` background, rounded corners. Tap-to-play not yet wired.
- [x] **Audio message chip** — `Surface` chip with `MusicNote` icon and "Audio message"
      label in `secondaryContainer` color. Tap-to-play not yet wired.
- [x] **MMS media in conversation list** — `previewText` extension returns "📷 Photo" /
      "🎥 Video" / "🎵 Audio message" when body is empty; used by both sync handlers.
- [ ] **Tap image → full-screen viewer** — `Dialog` or separate screen, pinch-to-zoom.
- [x] **Tap video → player dialog** — `VideoPlayerDialog` composable with ExoPlayer
      (media3 1.5.1); auto-plays on open; `DisposableEffect` releases player on dismiss;
      tapping the video thumbnail in a bubble opens it.
- [x] **Audio playback controls** — `MediaPlayer` play/pause on audio chip in `ThreadScreen`.
- [ ] **Rich media in reply bar** — ~~attachment button left of text field. Image picker
      (`PickVisualMedia`), camera capture. Requires `READ_MEDIA_IMAGES` / `CAMERA`.~~
      **Done (different approach):** `GetContent` launcher with `image/*` / `audio/*` MIME
      filter, attach button with dropdown, attachment preview chip, MMS send path via
      `MmsManagerWrapper` + WAP Binary PDU. Camera capture still pending.
- [ ] **Group MMS** — multiple recipient addresses → single thread with comma-joined
      display name. Show sender name/avatar per bubble within group thread.

### Contact integration
- [ ] **Contact photo / profile picture in avatar** — currently all
      avatars show a colored letter initial. `ContactsContract` lookup
      for the contact's photo URI should replace it when one exists;
      fall back to letter initial if no photo. Requires
      `READ_CONTACTS` (already granted). Use Coil `AsyncImage` with
      `loadThumbnail` or the photo URI directly.
- [x] **Phone number formatting** — `formatPhoneNumber()` in
      `PhoneNumberFormatter.kt`; E.164 NANP → `(xxx) xxx-xxxx`;
      wired in Conversations, Thread, and Search screens.
- [ ] **Multiple numbers per contact** — handle correctly during
      sync and display.
- [ ] **Save number prompt** — when receiving from unknown number,
      show "Add to contacts" banner above conversation.
- [ ] **Contact name refresh** — if contact name changes in system
      Contacts, update `Thread.displayName` on next sync.
- [x] **avatarColor seed fix** — `colorSeed = thread.address` passed
      to `LetterAvatar`; colors stable across contact name changes.
- [x] **Contact detail screen** — tapping the contact name/avatar in the
      thread `TopAppBar` opens `ContactDetailScreen`; nickname editing
      (Postmark-only, schema v11 `nickname TEXT`); "Open in Contacts" button
      (`ACTION_VIEW` for known contacts, `ACTION_INSERT_OR_EDIT` for unknown);
      Mute / Pin / Notifications toggles; shared media grid (Coil thumbnails);
      full-screen image viewer.

### Conversation list polish
- [ ] **Unread filter button** — a toggle button (e.g. envelope icon or
      "Unread" chip) in the conversation list top bar that, when active,
      filters the list to only threads that have at least one unread message.
      Tap again to clear the filter. Requires `isRead` flag already tracked
      per message; derive `hasUnread` on `ThreadEntity` (or compute from
      `MessageDao`) and expose a `showUnreadOnly: Boolean` toggle in
      `ConversationsViewModel`. Badge the button with the current unread
      thread count so the user knows at a glance how many are waiting.
- [ ] **Unread count badge** — unread message count pill on each
      thread row. Requires `isRead` flag on `MessageEntity`.
- [ ] **Swipe actions on conversation list** — swipe left: delete/archive with undo
      snackbar. Swipe right: mark as read. Standard Android expectation.
- [ ] **Swipe actions on message bubbles** — swipe right to reply (quote the
      message inline in the reply bar); swipe left to delete single message
      with undo snackbar. Standard iMessage/WhatsApp expectation.
- [ ] **Long-press multi-select** — select multiple threads for
      bulk delete/archive/mute.
- [x] **Pinned conversations** — `isPinned` on `ThreadEntity`; pins float
      to top; Pin/Unpin in thread ⋮ menu; `PushPin` icon in conversation row.
- [ ] **Friendly timestamps** — "just now", "2m", "9:41 AM", "Mon",
      "Apr 25" based on recency. Reuse `toFriendlyLabel()` logic
      already in the codebase.

### Blocking and spam (required for Play Store messaging category)
- [ ] **Block number** — wire up existing stub in ⋮ menu.
      Use Android `BlockedNumberContract` API for system-level
      blocking. Blocked numbers go to a "Blocked" folder, not deleted.
      Blocked threads must not generate notifications.
- [ ] **Blocked conversations screen** — accessible from Settings.
      Shows blocked threads with option to unblock.
- [ ] **Spam detection + Spam folder** — "Report as spam" option in
      thread ⋮ menu (and inline on notifications from unknown numbers).
      Moves thread to a separate Spam folder visible in the nav drawer
      or Settings. Add a `isSpam BOOLEAN DEFAULT 0` flag to
      `ThreadEntity` (Room migration required); filter spam threads
      out of the main conversation list. Consider basic heuristics
      (unknown sender, contains URL + short body) to auto-flag obvious
      spam with a dismissable banner. Required for Play Store messaging
      category approval.

### Search — remaining items
- [x] **Thread filter chip** — done.
- [x] **Jump to message from result** — done.
- [x] **Date range filter** — preset chips (Today / 7 days / 30 days)
      via `SearchDateRange` enum + `toBoundsMs()`. Single
      `searchMessagesFiltered()` DAO query handles all combos.
- [x] **Reaction filter** — emoji picker bottom sheet; filters via
      `searchMessagesFilteredWithReaction()` subquery on `reactions`.
- [x] **Reaction emoji list data-driven** — `ReactionDao.observeDistinctEmojis()`
      wired into `SearchScreen` via `SearchViewModel`; hardcoded list removed.
- [x] **SMS/MMS protocol filter chips** — "SMS" and "MMS" chips in `SearchScreen`;
      browse mode (protocol filter + blank query) supported via new `browseFiltered()`
      DAO query. Empty state updated to prompt usage.
- [ ] **Sort order toggle** — default is most-recent first; add a toggle
      (sort icon button in top bar or a chip) to switch between:
      - **Most recent** — `ORDER BY timestamp DESC` (default, already natural for FTS)
      - **By contact** — group results by thread (display name), sorted
        A–Z, with a sticky section header per thread showing the contact
        name + avatar. Within each group messages sort newest-first.
      `SearchViewModel` adds a `SortOrder` enum (`MOST_RECENT`, `BY_CONTACT`);
      the grouped path can be a pure in-memory transform on `results` (no
      new DAO query needed — just `groupBy { it.threadId }` + sort by
      `displayName`). `SearchUiState` needs `sortOrder` and a derived
      `groupedResults: Map<Thread, List<Message>>` for the `BY_CONTACT` view.
- [ ] **Reactions shown on search result rows** — when a message has
      reactions (already stored as `Message.reactions`), render the
      reaction pills below the body text inside `SearchResultRow` — the
      same `ReactionPills` composable used in the thread view. Currently
      `SearchResultRow` only shows the body text; it ignores `message.reactions`
      entirely. The search query already joins reactions (via
      `MessageRepository.observeByThread`) but the DAO query used by
      `SearchRepository.search()` should also populate `reactions` on each
      result. Check whether `searchRepository.search()` populates
      `Message.reactions` or returns empty lists; if the latter, update
      `SearchRepository` to join with `ReactionDao` (same pattern as
      `MessageRepository.observeByThread`).
- [ ] **"Reacted to" filter-message exclusion in results** — Apple reaction
      fallback phrases ("Liked \"...\""  etc.) are stored as both a
      `ReactionEntity` *and* left as a raw message in the `messages` table.
      These raw reaction-phrase messages currently appear as search results.
      Add a flag or filter to suppress them from the default result set
      (they are already parsed into reactions; showing the raw phrase is
      noise). Simplest approach: mark messages whose body matches the
      reaction-phrase pattern with a `isReactionMessage BOOLEAN DEFAULT 0`
      flag set during sync, then add `AND isReactionMessage = 0` to the
      default search query. Opt-in toggle could expose them if needed.
- [ ] **Search within thread** — entry point: search icon in thread
      toolbar. Scopes results to current `threadId`.
- [ ] **Contact/thread search** — global search currently only searches
      message bodies; add a second result section (or a tab) that matches
      `Thread.displayName` / `Thread.address` so users can find a contact
      by name without scrolling through the full conversations list.

### Performance & optimization
- [ ] **Heatmap query performance** — with 150k+ messages the heatmap is slow to load and
      unresponsive on month navigation. The `byDayOfWeekJson` / `byMonthJson` stats are
      pre-aggregated in `ThreadStats`, but the heatmap still does per-day message counts
      at query time. Profile the `StatsViewModel` heatmap flow and either: (a) pre-compute
      per-day counts into `ThreadStatsEntity` during `StatsUpdater` so month navigation is
      an in-memory lookup, or (b) add a dedicated index on `messages(threadId, timestamp)`
      and limit the query window to the displayed month. Target: month switch feels instant.
- [ ] **`StatsUpdater` incremental updates** — currently recomputes all stats from scratch
      on every sync. For large message sets this is slow. Only recompute stats for threads
      whose messages changed since `lastUpdatedAt`. Track a `dirtyThreadIds` set in
      `SyncWorker` and pass it to `StatsUpdater.updateStats(dirtyThreadIds)`.
- [ ] **LazyColumn key stability** — verify all `LazyColumn` item keys are stable IDs
      (not list positions). Unstable keys cause unnecessary recompositions as list data
      updates after sync.
- [ ] **Thread view initial load** — profile cold-open of a large thread (1000+ messages).
      `LazyColumn reverseLayout` with that many items may have a first-frame hitch;
      consider paging with `Pager` / `PagingSource` if the frame time is > 16ms.

### Export — image rendering
- [ ] **Image export** — render selected messages to `Canvas`,
      convert to `Bitmap`, compress to PNG, write to
      `getExternalFilesDir("exports")/`, share via
      `FileProvider` + `ACTION_SEND`.
- [ ] **"Share as image" button** — restore to `ExportBottomSheet`
      once rendering is in place.

### Backup — remaining
- [x] **Backup history list** — done.
- [x] **WorkManager status indicator** — done.
- [x] **Per-thread backup policy dialog** — done.
- [ ] **Backup restore** — read JSON, validate version field,
      apply to Room with migration version check. Show progress.
      Warn user that restore merges with existing data.

## 🟢 TIER 3 — Polish and Depth

### Delivery timestamps + read receipts
- [ ] **Store sentAt + deliveredAt** — add `sentAt: Long?` and
      `readAt: Long?` to `MessageEntity`. Room migration required.
- [ ] **Read receipt double tick** — extend `DeliveryStatusIndicator`
      to show ✓✓ in accent color when `readAt` is set (MMS only).
- [ ] **Message info panel** — tapping Info in action bar slides up
      bottom sheet: sent at / delivered at / read at / character
      count / message parts count.
- [ ] **Document RCS** — add note to README that RCS is not supported
      (requires carrier agreements). Position as future roadmap item.

### Stats — remaining
- [x] **Numbers style** — done.
- [x] **Heatmap style** — done.
- [ ] **Charts style** — monthly bar chart, sent/received doughnut,
      emoji bar chart. Use `Vico` charting library (Compose-native,
      actively maintained). Add to `build.gradle`.
- [x] **Persist topReactionEmojis** — `topReactionEmojisJson` now
      persisted in both `ThreadStatsEntity` and `GlobalStatsEntity`
      via `StatsUpdater` (Room migration 4→5).
- [ ] **"Gone quiet" detection** — surface threads that have dropped
      significantly below their usual frequency for 7+ days.
      Show in global stats as "You haven't talked to Jake in a while."

### Thread view — deeper polish
- [x] **Muted thread visual indicator** — `NotificationsOff` icon (14 dp)
      shown in `ConversationsScreen` thread rows when `isMuted = true`.
- [x] **Reaction chip cluster-aware spacing** — Spacer(12.dp) only
      added at BOTTOM/SINGLE cluster positions; TOP/MIDDLE use natural
      inter-bubble gap.
- [x] **Reaction chip theming** — ReactionPills uses
      MaterialTheme.colorScheme.primaryContainer / surfaceContainer /
      primary / outlineVariant; no hardcoded hex values.
- [ ] **Reaction chip overflow handling** — short messages (e.g. "Yes")
      with 3+ reactions can produce a pill row wider than the bubble.
      For sent messages use a negative horizontal offset from
      `Alignment.BottomStart` so pills extend leftward past the bubble
      edge rather than overflowing right.
- [ ] **Haptic feedback on reaction toggle** — fire
      `HapticFeedbackType.LongPress` when a reaction pill is tapped
      to add tactile confirmation and make the interaction feel
      premium.
- [ ] **Full emoji picker for reactions** — the current emoji popup
      shows only ~7 quick-pick reactions. Add a "＋" button that
      opens a full bottom-sheet emoji picker (all categories, search
      bar, recents row) matching the experience in Google Messages.
      Use `androidx.emoji2` or a Compose emoji-picker library.
      Users expect access to the full emoji set for reactions.
- [ ] **Bubble tap for link/phone detection** — auto-linkify URLs,
      phone numbers, addresses in message body. Tap URL → browser,
      tap phone → dial dialog, tap address → Maps.
- [ ] **Copy individual message** — already in action bar. Verify
      it copies plain text without timestamps.
- [ ] **Forward message** — action bar Forward: opens share sheet
      or internal compose with message body pre-filled.
- [ ] **Message info** — wire up Info in action bar once delivery
      timestamps are stored.
- [ ] **Selection mode — Copy format** — verify friendly plain text
      output matches the designed format:
        Conversation with [Name]
        [Date]
        ────────────────────────
        Name (10:03 AM)
        Message text
        ❤️ reacted by Name
- [ ] **Pinch to zoom text** (ThreadScreen)
      Pinch gesture in thread view scales message
      bubble text size up or down. Persisted to
      SharedPreferences as a float multiplier
      (range 0.8–1.6, default 1.0). Applied via
      LocalTextStyle or a custom CompositionLocal
      so all bubble text scales together. Reset
      option in Settings → Appearance. Respects
      system font size as baseline.
- [ ] **Flag message for later** — long-press → "Remind me to reply";
      user picks a time; schedules a notification with a jump-to-message
      deep-link action. Flagged bubble gets a small 🔖 indicator.
      Flagged messages list accessible from thread ⋮ menu or global
      Settings.

### Starred & pinned messages
- [ ] **Star / pin a message** — long-press → "Pin" (Discord-style).
      `isPinned` boolean on `MessageEntity`. Room migration required.
      Wording TBD (pin / star / favorite — same underlying feature).
- [ ] **Pinned messages panel** — accessible from thread toolbar icon
      or ⋮ menu. Scrollable list of pinned messages in this thread;
      tap jumps to that message in context.
- [ ] **Pinned indicator on bubble** — small inline 📌 label or icon
      on pinned bubbles so they are identifiable while scrolling.
- [ ] **Pinned messages exempt from auto-cleanup** — coordinate with
      message retention settings below; pinned messages are never
      swept by automatic or bulk delete operations.

### Message retention & auto-cleanup
- [ ] **Auto-cleanup setting** — new section in Settings alongside
      Backup. Configurable threshold: 1 month / 3 months / 6 months /
      1 year / custom / never (default). WorkManager periodic job
      executes cleanup on schedule.
- [ ] **Scope modes** — three options selectable in Settings:
        Global — apply one threshold to all threads.
        Per-thread override — individual threads can carry their own
          threshold, set via the thread ⋮ menu.
        Exclusionary — global threshold applies to every thread
          *except* those added to an explicit exclusion list in
          Settings; useful for protecting key conversations while
          letting everything else age out.
- [ ] **Preview before delete** — before each cleanup run, surface
      a summary ("X messages across Y threads will be deleted") with
      an option to review the affected threads or cancel. Suppressible
      with a "Don't ask again" toggle.
- [ ] **Locked messages** — `isLocked` boolean on `MessageEntity`.
      Long-press → "Lock" action. Locked messages are skipped by
      auto-cleanup, global bulk-delete, and all non-explicit delete
      operations. Require a deliberate single-message delete to
      remove. Show a 🔒 indicator on the bubble.
- [ ] **Pinned + locked exemption enforced in cleanup job** —
      cleanup query must filter out rows where `isPinned = 1` OR
      `isLocked = 1` before deleting.
- [ ] **Cleanup log** — record last run time, threads affected, and
      message count deleted. Surface in the Backup status area in
      Settings.

### Settings — completeness
- [ ] **Notification settings screen** — per-conversation sound,
      vibration, and privacy mode toggles. Link to system
      notification settings for channel management.
- [ ] **Storage usage screen** — show database size, attachment
      cache size, backup folder size. Button to clear attachment
      cache.
- [ ] **About screen** — app version, build number, licenses,
      link to GitHub.
- [ ] **Real app icon** — replace the placeholder envelope with
      proper branded artwork.
- [ ] **Custom font selection** — Settings → Appearance; let user
      choose a font family for message bubbles (e.g. Default / Serif /
      Monospace / a curated set of Google Fonts). Persisted to
      SharedPreferences and applied via a custom `FontFamily`
      CompositionLocal so all bubble text updates without restart.

## 🔵 TIER 4 — Infrastructure / Housekeeping

### CI and test hygiene
- [ ] **GitHub Actions CI** — run unit tests on every push,
      instrumented tests on merge to main. Badge in README.
- [ ] **Replace `runBlocking` in instrumented tests** with `runTest`
      from `kotlinx-coroutines-test`.
- [ ] **Add test size annotations** — `@SmallTest` / `@MediumTest` /
      `@LargeTest` on all test classes.
- [ ] **`@VisibleForTesting`** on `PostmarkDatabase.FTS_CALLBACK`
      and `DATABASE_NAME`.
- [ ] **`.gitattributes`** — add `* text=auto` to suppress CRLF
      line-ending warnings.

### Accessibility
- [ ] **Content descriptions** on all icon buttons for screen readers.
- [ ] **Dynamic text size support** — bubbles should reflow at large
      text sizes, not clip.
- [ ] **RTL layout support** — mirror layout for Arabic/Hebrew users.
      Test with device set to Arabic locale.

### Play Store prep (when ready)
- [ ] **Privacy policy** — required for any app requesting SMS
      permissions. Host at a public URL.
- [ ] **App description copy** — 80-char short description +
      4000-char long description. Screenshots x8. Feature graphic.
- [ ] **Content rating questionnaire** — messaging apps require
      answering questions about user-generated content.
- [ ] **Target SDK review** — ensure all Android 14/15 behavior
      changes are handled (exact alarms, photo picker, health
      connect, etc.).
- [ ] **Samsung Galaxy Store** — consider dual submission.
      Samsung users are primary target given S24 Ultra testing.
